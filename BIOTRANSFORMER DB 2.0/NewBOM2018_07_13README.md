1. The structure is drived from CDK
2. the structure's hydoygen remined while mapping the atoms
3. hence the site or bond of metabolism (number tends to be bigger because of remained H atoms)


Comment field:
InXenosite = in Xenosite database; the difference is the stereochemsitry
No reference = there is no reference;


Step:
1. try to find in Xenosite, to compare; if exists, flag the cell
2. if the compound metabolism can't be googled; try different name;
3. try the paper from biotransformerDB2.0
